# Arduino-Ohmmeter
In this project, I have automated the measurement for resistors using an arduino, LEDs, and a reference resistor(100k Ohms). This project is for anyone with a couple resistors or like me, with a million resistors. The arduino prints on the serial monitor or the 16X2 LCD monitor the measurements and the average resistance of the resistor and gives a 10 second countdown for the user to replace and switch the resistor.
